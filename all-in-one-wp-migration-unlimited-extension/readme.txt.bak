== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why was this plugin created? =
This plugin is a fork of the Unlimited extension by all-in-one-migration after they changed there EULA policy and cancelled my licence I decided to fork and update and merge there changes moving forward into this extension, you can read more about it here

= Can anyone do this? =
The plugin is GPL and the GPL licence allows you to do this, if you want to make your own fork this plugin and knock yourself out
